# Upload Double Selection Fix

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing a double file selection prompt when trying to upload images through the web interface. This occurred because there were multiple conflicting event handlers attached to the upload area and browse button.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Multiple Event Handlers**: The upload area had both a click handler and the browse button had an inline `onclick` attribute
2. **Event Bubbling**: Click events were bubbling up from the browse button to the upload area
3. **Conflicting Logic**: The reset functionality was interfering with the file selection process

## Files Modified

### `templates/upload.html`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Inline onclick**: 
   - Changed from `onclick="document.getElementById('file-input').click()"` 
   - To proper event listener with ID `browse-btn`

2. **Fixed Event Handlers**:
   - Added proper event prevention with `stopPropagation()`
   - Created dedicated browse button click handler
   - Separated reset functionality from file selection

3. **Improved JavaScript Structure**:
   - Added `resetUpload()` function for cleaner code
   - Better event handling hierarchy
   - Prevented event conflicts

4. **Updated CSS**:
   - Removed `cursor: pointer` from upload area to avoid confusion
   - Added proper pointer events handling for browse button

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```html
<button onclick="document.getElementById('file-input').click()">Choose File</button>
```
```javascript
uploadArea.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // This would trigger alongside the button click
});
```

### After Fix:
```html
<button type="button" id="browse-btn">Choose File</button>
```
```javascript
browseBtn.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    fileInput.click();
});

uploadArea.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    // Only for reset, not file selection
    if (!uploadPreview.classList.contains('d-none') && e.target !== browseBtn) {
        resetUpload();
    }
});
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Single File Dialog**: Users now see only one file selection dialog
2. **Clear Interaction**: Browse button has distinct functionality
3. **Better Reset**: Clicking the upload area when preview is shown resets the selection
4. **Drag & Drop**: Still works perfectly for drag and drop functionality

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the upload page
2. Click "Choose File" button - should show file dialog only once
3. Select an image - should preview correctly
4. Click on upload area (not button) when preview is shown - should reset
5. Drag and drop an image - should work without issues

The fix ensures a smooth, single-prompt file selection experience for users while maintaining all existing functionality.
